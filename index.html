                    which included modifying React components and hooks, creating new MongoDB documents, dealing with Google authentication, 
                    and connected the database to the backend and the backend to the frontend using TypeScript.

                    only one jar file that comes with a built in IDE that runs MomentumCode files as well as a built in API for quick reference. The language
                    offers core programming basics like printing, variables, loops, and arrays. I worked on creating the IDE and the API for reference.
