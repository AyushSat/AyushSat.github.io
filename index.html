                    At Apple, I worked within the Health app organization, specifically on the team that manages the large data flow between numerous hospital APIs and our users'
                    iPhone's, allowing them to receive their personalized health data in real time. I revitalized an internal tool that was used by multiple teams to monitor
                    conformance, uptime, and status of thousands of healthcare provider APIs. <br> <br> Using Java, I added numerous API endpoints that performed specialized data filtering,
                    while still integrating with database caches to reduce calls to our Cassandra database by about 300%. I also utilized React and TypeScript to completely redesign
                    the entire UI that adheres to Apple's strict Human Interface Guidelines. <br> <br> With new features affecting the flow of data through our system, I also added new charts 
                    that helped employees easily discern patterns between passing and failing APIs, as well as large scale incidents. This feature was used during my internship as my
                    code hit prod and full time engineers used my work to detect production APIs that were showing duplicate sign in flows for users in prod! I also competed in Apple's
                    annual intern innovation contest, where among 150 teams, I placed top 10 and presented a new idea to 7 of Apple's most important Vice Presidents.

                    At VMware, I worked within the VMware Cloud department, on a team that was largely responsible for general security of our 
                    cloud offerings and compliance with numerous regimes like PCI and SOC2, which was especially important when dealing with government clients.
                    In order to request compliance for our services, an arduous cycle occured between auditors, engineers, and lawyers where collecting evidence 
                    to prove compliance often took months. <br> <br> I helped develop a solution to this problem called Evidence As Code, which would take in a formatted
                    evidence request and fetch any necessary data and process it in a manner ready to be shipped straight to an auditor, allowing for scalability 
                    to other services and repeatability across different compliance cycles. I specifically worked on interacting with any evidence stored on GitLab,
                    as well as creating an end to end test to show upper management. I also bundled evidence data with attestation information, version history, 
                    and SHA256 data checksums.

                    At my school, I picked up a part time job at our student center as a junior web developer, 
                    eventually converting to a senior role coupled with numerous other jobs like DevOps and Security Engineering.
                    One of the biggest responsibilities I had was maintaining and improving upon numerous different products we had,
                    which involved writing Angular, TypeScript, C#, and .NET code. I also interacted heavily with deployment technologies
                    like AWS, IIS Express, and Jenkins. <br> <br> Currently, I'm architecting and developing two new products. The first is a health checker
                    application that will repeatedly scan and monitor the system health of numerous student center resources like A/V technology,
                    websites, and billboards. I'm also architecting and creating a liability form that can be used to collect important information
                    for any person trying to reserve student center resources for an event. The job also comes with many odd, one off tasks, such as using
                    advanced data structures and algorithms like a Trie and BFS to classify IP address subnet masks as malicious or not, to migrating entire applications
                    from UCI WebAuth, an older, insecure authentication scheme, to a newer, SAML based, scheme called Shibboleth.

                    I started my software engineering journey at a startup that aimed to automate the entire vulnerability 
                    detection and remediation process of cloud projects and instances. A small team of me and two other interns
                    created a full product in 3 months that allowed users to allow access to their cloud instances via IAM 
                    service accounts, run a suite of 86 different industry standard vulnerability scans as taken from the Center 
                    of Internet Security, and implement automatic remediations for particularly glaring vulnerabilities. <br> <br> I did this 
                    by creating a backend API in Node.js that utilized the Google Cloud Platform SDK to access resources like 
                    service accounts, Compute, VPC networks, and security groups. I also programmed a multipage portal using JavaScript
                    where users can select projects to review, author new security policies, and interact with said backend API to detect 
                    and remedy vulnerabilities.

                        Using structured illumination, I captured dozens of images of a figurine from two different camera angles.
                        I also captured images of a chessboard with known size in order for calibration. Then, I used OpenCV's chessboard
                        corners function to calibrate the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters of the camera. Using the images of the figurine,
                        I wrote algorithms to mask out the background of the image, and used Matplotlib to map out my scene. Then, using the Scipy
                        Delauney algorithm to generate triangles based on the points of each face of the figurine. I implemented manual mesh 
                        smoothing algorithms like triangle based pruning, boundary pruning, and point averaging. Finally, using the triangle 
                        and color information, I imported the meshes into MeshLab and used Poisson based surface reconstruction and point based
                        mesh gluing algorithms to create a full, 3D, color mesh.
